I. Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux 

    1. Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux
        Download the latest release with the command:
          # curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    
    2. Validate the binary (optional)
        Download the kubectl checksum file:
          # curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
        Validate the kubectl binary against the checksum file:
          # echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check

    3.Install kubectl
          # sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    
    4.Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
        # kubectl version --client
        or
        # kubectl version --client --output=yaml

II. Install using native package management 
    Debian-based distributions:
    Note:
        In releases older than Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04, folder /etc/apt/keyrings does not exist by default, and it should be created before the curl command.
            -> mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
        1. Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:

            sudo apt-get update
            # apt-transport-https may be a dummy package; if so, you can skip that package
            sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
       2.  Download the public signing key for the Kubernetes package repositories. The same signing key is used for all repositories so you can disregard the version in the URL:
    
            # If the folder `/etc/apt/keyrings` does not exist, it should be created before the curl command, read the note below.
            # sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
            curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.34/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
            sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg # allow unprivileged APT programs to read this keyring
        Note:
            In releases older than Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04, folder /etc/apt/keyrings does not exist by default, and it should be created before the curl command.

       3.  Add the appropriate Kubernetes apt repository. If you want to use Kubernetes version different than v1.34, replace v1.34 with the desired minor version in the command below:
            This overwrites any existing configuration in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
           # echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.34/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
           # sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list   # helps tools such as command-not-found to work correctly

    Note:
    To upgrade kubectl to another minor release, you'll need to bump the version in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list before running apt-get update and apt-get upgrade. 
    This procedure is described in more detail in Changing The Kubernetes Package Repository.
